<h3> Description</h3>
<p>Juicy on the inside, and served with liquid gold pan juices loaded with flavour, this is THE Roast Chicken recipe you’ll make over and over again!</p>
<p>A classic roast chicken recipe should be in everyone's repertoire. Make this oven baked chicken with gravy for a satisfying Sunday lunch.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 free range chicken, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz</li>
    <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
    <li>small bunch thyme (optional)</li>
    <li>25g butter, softened</li>
    <li><b>For the gravy:</b></li>
    <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
    <li>250ml chicken stock (a cube is fine)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li> Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it. </li>
<li> Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1 ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t swamp it. </li>
<li> Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using. </li>
<li> Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a skewer 
    and the juices should run clear.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the dish, 
    let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.</li>
<li>While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin over a low flame, then stir in 1 tbsp flour and sizzle until you have a light brown, sandy paste.</li>
<li>Gradually pour in 250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you have a thickened sauce.</li>
<li>Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky bits from the tin.</li>
<li>Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste. When you carve the bird, add any extra juices to the gravy.</li>
