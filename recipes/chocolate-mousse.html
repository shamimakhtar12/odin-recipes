    <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy, one pot is satisfying but always leaves me wanting more…….</p>
<p>Make this classic chocolate dessert in minutes with just a few ingredients – light yet delicious. Perfect for fuss-free entertaining to end a rich meal</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>150g 70% dark chocolate, plus extra to serve</li>
    <li>6 egg whites</li>
    <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche and grated chocolate, to serve</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li> Melt the chocolate in the microwave in a microwaveable bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until just melted. </li>
<li> Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, scatter in the sugar and whisk again until the mixture forms stiff peaks when you lift the whisk out (around 30 seconds).</li>
<li> Add a third of the egg white to the melted chocolate and mix vigorously, working fast so the chocolate doesn’t cool and harden. Then fold in the remaining egg 
    whites carefully using a spatula or large metal spoon.</li>
<li> Spoon into 4 glasses or ramekins and set in the fridge for 2-3 hours. Serve each with a dollop of crème fraiche and shavings of dark chocolate.</li>
